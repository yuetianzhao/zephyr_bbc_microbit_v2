The force of gravity is given by the following equation:

`F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2`

Where:

- `F` is the gravitational force between two objects
- `G` is the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 N·(m/kg)^2)
- `m1` and `m2` are the masses of the two objects
- `r` is the distance between the centers of the two objects

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ in an inner product space, it holds that:

$$|\langle \vec{a}, \vec{b} \rangle | \leq \|\vec{a}\| \|\vec{b}\|$$

where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ denotes the inner product and $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the norm of a vector. This inequality is a fundamental result in linear algebra and has many important applications in various fields of mathematics and science.
